SYSTEM A = Claude Code's built-in "Workflows" feature. Its internals are exhaustively documented in ${CC_DOC} — READ IT.
SYSTEM B = "omegacode", a standalone CLI in ${TOOL}. READ ${TOOL}/DESIGN.md and the relevant files under ${TOOL}/src/.
For your assigned dimension, enumerate each concrete feature and classify B vs A:
- "parity": B matches A's behavior.
- "partial": B has it but weaker/different (explain how).
- "missing": A has it, B does not.
- "extra": B has it, A does not.
Be specific and evidence-based — cite the actual files/lines you read in B. Do not guess; read the code.
