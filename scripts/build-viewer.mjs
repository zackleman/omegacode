// Builds the React viewer as a self-installing step so a fresh clone -> install -> build -> npm pack
// works end to end. The root package is npm-governed (package-lock.json); the viewer is pnpm-governed
// (pnpm-lock.yaml + pnpm-workspace.yaml). `npm install` at the root does NOT install the viewer's
// deps, and `pnpm -C viewer build` does not install them either, so prepublishOnly used to fail on a
// fresh clone. This script bridges the two: install the viewer deps with pnpm (frozen to its
// lockfile) if they're missing, then build. When pnpm itself isn't on PATH (npm-only machine), fall
// back to `npx -y pnpm@10`, which only requires npm — keeping the root story npm-driven end to end.
