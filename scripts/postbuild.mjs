// Portable post-build step (runs after `tsup` in the `build` script). Replaces the POSIX-only
// `rm -rf dist/web && cp -r viewer/dist dist/web` so the build + prepublishOnly work on Windows too.
// It runs after tsup (not as onSuccess) because tsup's dts worker manages dist independently and
// would clobber files written from onSuccess.
//
// Two jobs:
//   1. Copy the built React viewer (viewer/dist) into dist/web. serve.ts resolves its web assets at
//      join(__dirname, "web") and __dirname is dist/ once bundled.
//   2. Copy the self-contained author ambient types to dist/ambient.d.ts (the target of the
//      package.json "./ambient" export). The source MUST NOT import any other module, or the d.ts is
//      dead on arrival for npm consumers — we assert that here so a regression fails the build loudly.
