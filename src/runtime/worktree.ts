// Git worktree isolation for parallel file-mutating agents. Matches Claude Code's behavior:
// create + lock a fresh worktree, and on teardown auto-remove if the agent changed nothing, or
// unlock + preserve the branch for review if it did. Creation is serialized by the caller.
//
// Two correctness rules drive this module:
//   - The base commit is recorded at CREATION time (in the worktree's local git config) and compared
//     against that exact base at teardown. Re-reading HEAD at teardown is wrong: if main advanced,
//     an agent's committed work would show 0-ahead and be force-deleted.
//   - Any failure to determine "did the agent change something" is treated as DIRTY. We preserve on
//     doubt and never force-delete on an undetected state.
